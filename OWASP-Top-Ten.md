<h3>A01: Broken Access Control</h3>
<p>Access control vulnerabilities often result from flawed authentication mechanisms or insufficiently enforced user privilege restrictions. Issues like predictable resource locations or insecure direct object references are common. Techniques such as privilege escalation, parameter manipulation, or URL tampering can bypass these controls. Strengthening security involves implementing fine-grained access controls, role-based access control (RBAC), and cryptographic authentication methods like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth.</p>

<h3>A02: Cryptographic Failures</h3>
<p>Vulnerabilities in cryptography encompass weak key generation, hardcoded keys/passwords, or outdated algorithms prone to attacks like brute force or cryptographic collisions. Enhancing data security requires employing robust cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES, SHA-2), secure key management practices, and implementing cryptographic protocols (TLS/SSL) with updated cipher suites.</p>

<h3>A03: Injection</h3>
<p>Injection attacks exploit input validation vulnerabilities, allowing malicious code insertion into interpreted languages or SQL queries. Mitigation strategies involve input sanitization through prepared statements, stored procedures, or ORM frameworks to prevent SQL injection. To counter Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), utilizing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers and output encoding is essential.</p>

<h3>A04: Insecure Design</h3>
<p>Insecure design flaws include poor session management, inadequate logging/monitoring, or improper error handling. Addressing these requires adopting secure design patterns, using cryptographic nonces for session management, comprehensive logging, and graceful error handling strategies without exposing sensitive data.</p>

<h3>A05: Security Misconfiguration</h3>
<p>Misconfigurations often arise from default settings, overly permissive configurations, or neglecting to remove unnecessary features/services. Reducing misconfiguration risks involves applying security headers (e.g., HTTP Strict Transport Security), frequent security audits of server configurations, and employing infrastructure management tools like Ansible or Chef.</p>

<h3>A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components</h3>
<p>Risk from third-party library vulnerabilities due to outdated/unpatched components requires Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools for accurate component inventories. Continuous monitoring for known vulnerabilities and a robust patch management process are crucial in mitigating these risks.</p>

<h3>A07: Identification and Authentication Failures</h3>
<p>Authentication weaknesses, including inadequate credential storage, weak password policies, or lacking multi-factor authentication (MFA), expose systems to unauthorized access. Strengthening authentication involves implementing adaptive authentication mechanisms, stronger hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2), and enforcing MFA across applications.</p>

<h3>A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures</h3>
<p>Maintaining software and data integrity involves securing CI/CD pipelines from tampering. Techniques like signed artifacts, code and container image signing, and stringent access controls on repositories and build environments mitigate integrity risks.</p>

<h3>A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures</h3>
<p>Inadequate logging and monitoring hinder an organization's ability to detect and respond to security incidents effectively. Enhancing capabilities involves centralized log management, integration with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, and leveraging Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms.</p>

<h3>A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</h3>
<p>SSRF vulnerabilities arise when attackers manipulate server-side requests to access internal systems/resources. Mitigating these involves proper input validation and restricting access through firewalls or network proxies. Employing Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) or employing allow-list-based URL validation helps validate and restrict outgoing requests.</p>
